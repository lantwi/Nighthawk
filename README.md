##Unsolved Problems
- We are still in the process of having each message boarch being attached to each neighborhood list
- Wanting to create an open chat for users to update one another on the status of late-night hotspots in particular neighborhoods
- Some bugs in rendering Bar names in the message board
- Want to create individual profiles for each bar

##Approach + Team Dynamic
- Divided up work based on strengths and features. Delegated Guy to work on the styling and front-end work, Keven to work on message board and assist with backend, and then Lesley and Noah were assigned full duties of using Passport for the authentication as well as the majority of the back-end functionality. Lesley dealt with entirely with sorting out the Git issues, conflicts, while Noah took on the role of the Product Manager and made sure each of the tasks were being accomplished in a timely mannar and the work was being distributed appropriately.
